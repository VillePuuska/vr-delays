# VR delays

Some Python helper functions to get and analyze VR train schedule data from the [Digitraffic - Railway traffic API](https://www.digitraffic.fi/en/railway-traffic/) (NOTE: the API docs in English are very limited, see the [Finnish docs](https://www.digitraffic.fi/rautatieliikenne/) for much more detailed info).

Mainly going to be used for myself to figure out what train I should take to get to the office and how reliable the schedule is. Maybe this will be useful for someone else as well.
